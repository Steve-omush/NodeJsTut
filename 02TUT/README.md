# Day 2

## File Operations

0 . writeFile Function -  write to a file

1 . readFile Function - read a file and returns data or catches and throws an error

2 . appendFile - appends data to a file. If the file doesn't fle, it creates a new one. Just like writeFile function

3 . rename Function - used to rename a file. 

* . Learnt about callbacks in JS as JS employs asynchronous functions

* . writeFile Function can have appendFile Function as its callback while the same appendFile Function can have rename Function as its callback.

* . This ensures the writeFile function creates a new file and writes initial text, the appendFile will then append more text while the rename Function will then rename the file created by writeFile fnction. All this happens in order.


* . I'm still trying to understand Callbacks and Async/Await function :grin:
